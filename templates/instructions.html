            <b><font style ="font-size:160%;"> What you will be doing: </font></b><br>
            In this experiment, you will be taking part in a quiz with a group of 10-15 other people. <br> Everyone is given a random Player ID number <br> You will have to answer <b> <font colour="red"> 100 general knowledge questions. </font></b> <br> There are four topics: <b> <font color="green"> Geography, </font> <font color="orange">  Art History, </font> <font color="purple"> Language recognition, </font> and <font color="blue"> Weight estimation. <br> </font> </b> Some questions have pictures, others do not. <br> You will have <b> <font colour="red">15 Seconds </font></b> to answer each question. <br> If you do not answer in 15 seconds, you will not score a point for that question. <br> If you do not respond to a question for over 1 minute you will delay the rest of your group and therefore will not be able to continue to the end <br>  You will not be told if you answered a question correctly or incorrectly throughout the quiz. You will be told your total score at the end of the quiz. <br><br>
            <b> <font style ="font-size:160%;">Points and Payment: </font></b><br>
            Everyone gets <b> <font colour="red"> $10 </font> </b> for completing the quiz. 
            You get one point for each correct answer. <br> 
            If you score <b> <font colour="red"> over 85 points </font> </b> you will receive <b><font color="red" style="font-size:150%;"">$20</font></b> bonus payment. <br><br>
            <b> <font style ="font-size:160%;">Asking someone else: </font> </b> <br>
            If you are unsure of an answer, you can select <b> <font color="red"> "Ask Someone Else" </font> </b> to copy the answer of one of the other players. <br> When you select <b><font color="red">"Ask Someone Else"</font></b> you will be shown the Player ID of every other player in the group who answered that question.<br> You will not be able to see their answer, but, <b>if the player you choose answered correctly, you will also get a point for that question.</b> <br> If the person you choose answered incorrectly, you will <b>not</b> get a point for that question. <br><br>
            <b> <font style ="font-size:160%;">Practice Round: </font> </b> <br>
            You will now complete four practice questions before you begin the real quiz, to familiarise yourself with how the buttons work. No one can score points in the practice round.
